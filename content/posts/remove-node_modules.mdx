# How to remove node_modules from your project

Some times we get weired errors about not finding a dependency, and the solution sometimes is just to delete the node_modules file and the package-lock.json if you're using npm.

### Run the following command if using Bash or Powershell on windows

```
rm -rf node_modules
```
